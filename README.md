### Exercise-2 (LICENSE is in LICENSE file)

#### Explanation of License Design

This license is based on the MIT License to keep it simple and easy for anyone to use. The wording closely follows MIT’s structure so developers immediately recognize the standard “AS IS” disclaimer.

Three additions were included: Attribution, Privacy & Transparency, and No Harmful Use.
These were kept minimal without introducing heavy restrictions or copyright requirements.
What we came up with is just enough guidance to ensure ethical use of the Model.
